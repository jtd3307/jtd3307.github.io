              <p>In the Spring of 2020, as Covid-19 shut down public life and forced us all into quarantine,
                the Northwestern University "Wildcat" Marching Band (NUMB) was yearning for a way to continue playing together.</p>
              <p>Taking inspiration from other bands and choirs who had made virtual music videos, I took the initiative to begin one for NUMB.
                With the help of NUMB Director Daniel J. Farris, I reached out to the band membership to garner interest, and it took little convincing
                these purple-bleeding musicians on board. And what better tune to choose than our beloved fight song?</p>

              <p>Individual players were given a demo track to listen and play along to as they recorded their parts.
                Roughly 30 members from all sections submitted video files, which were compiled via Google Drive.</p>
              <p>From there, I first stitched together the audio tracks of each player into one unified piece, making
                careful adjustments to the timing, volume, and balance between instruments.</p>
              <p>Finally, I brought together the video portion in Adobe Premiere. From escalating Zoom-like grid patterns to animations
                to our signature "N" formation, I strove to create a visual collage as compelling as a halftime performance on the field.</p>

              <p>The video premiered to the public on May 22, 2020 to widespread acclaim from current students, alumni, athletic and academic staff,
                and many members of the Northwestern and Big Ten communities.</p>
              <p>While the pandemic has dragged on far longer than anyone wanted and irreparably disrupted the marching band season for Northwestern
                and countless other schools, I'm proud to have helped bring my fellow musicians together one more time to honor the organization
                that has so greatly impacted our lives.</p>
